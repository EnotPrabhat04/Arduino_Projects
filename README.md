An Arduino-based Binary Counter is a simple and interactive project that demonstrates how numbers are represented in binary form using LEDs.
This project uses an Arduino board and four LEDs to create a 4-bit binary counter. Upon receiving input from the user via the Serial Monitor.
The counter increments from 0 to 15, displaying each number in its binary form using the LEDs.
Each LED represents a single binary bit (0 or 1). The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of digital electronics, binary counting, and Arduino programming. 
It's an excellent hands-on learning experience for beginners in microcontroller-based applications.
